the value of Zp may be unknown. The proposal distribution itself is chosen to be
sufficiently simple that it is straightforward to draw samples from it directly. At
each cycle of the algorithm, we generate a candidate sample z[â‹†] from the proposal
distribution and then accept the sample according to an appropriate criterion.
In the basic Metropolis algorithm (Metropolis et al., 1953), we assume that the
proposal distribution is symmetric, that is q(zA|zB) = q(zB|zA) for all values of
**zA and zB. The candidate sample is then accepted with probability**
