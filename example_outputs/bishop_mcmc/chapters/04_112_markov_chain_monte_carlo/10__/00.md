If a distribution is invariant with respect to each of the base transitions, then obviously it will also be invariant with respect to either of the T (z[′], z) given by (11.42)
or (11.43). For the case of the mixture (11.42), if each of the base transitions satisfies detailed balance, then the mixture transition T will also satisfy detailed balance. This does not hold for the transition probability constructed using (11.43), although by symmetrizing the order of application of the base transitions, in the form
_B1, B2, . . ., BK, BK, . . ., B2, B1, detailed balance can be restored. A common ex-_
ample of the use of composite transition probabilities is where each base transition
changes only a subset of the variables.
