**z[′]**

Note that a given Markov chain may have more than one invariant distribution. For
instance, if the transition probabilities are given by the identity transformation, then
any distribution will be invariant.
A sufficient (but not necessary) condition for ensuring that the required distribution p(z) is invariant is to choose the transition probabilities to satisfy the property
of detailed balance, defined by

_p[⋆](z)T_ (z, z[′]) = p[⋆](z[′])T (z[′], z) (11.40)

for the particular distribution p[⋆](z). It is easily seen that a transition probability
that satisfies detailed balance with respect to a particular distribution will leave that
distribution invariant, because
