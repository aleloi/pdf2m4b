Earlier we introduced the basic Metropolis algorithm, without actually demonstrating that it samples from the required distribution. Before giving a proof, we
first discuss a generalization, known as the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm (Hastings, 1970), to the case where the proposal distribution is no longer a symmetric
function of its arguments. In particular at step τ of the algorithm, in which the current state is z[(][τ] [)], we draw a sample z[⋆] from the distribution qk(z|z[(][τ] [)]) and then
accept it with probability Ak(z[⋆], zτ ) where
