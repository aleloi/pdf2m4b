By assumption, it will be feasible to sample from this approximation in the
I-step.

Note that we are making a (somewhat artificial) distinction between parameters θ
and hidden variables Z. From now on, we blur this distinction and focus simply on
the problem of drawing samples from a given posterior distribution.
