Gibbs sampling (Geman and Geman, 1984) is a simple and widely applicable Markov
chain Monte Carlo algorithm and can be seen as a special case of the MetropolisHastings algorithm.

Consider the distribution p(z) = p(z1, . . ., zM ) from which we wish to sample,
and suppose that we have chosen some initial state for the Markov chain. Each step
of the Gibbs sampling procedure involves replacing the value of one of the variables
by a value drawn from the distribution of that variable conditioned on the values of
the remaining variables. Thus we replace zi by a value drawn from the distribution
_p(zi|z\i), where zi denotes the i[th]_ component of z, and z\i denotes z1, . . ., zM but
with zi omitted. This procedure is repeated either by cycling through the variables

**p** **g**

in some particular order or by choosing the variable to be updated at each step at
random from some distribution.
For example, suppose we have a distribution p(z1, z2, z3) over three variables,
and at step τ of the algorithm we have selected values z1[(][τ] [)][, z]2[(][τ] [)] and z3[(][τ] [)][. We first]
replace z1[(][τ] [)] by a new value z1[(][τ] [+1)] obtained by sampling from the conditional distribution
_p(z1|z2[(][τ]_ [)][, z]3[(][τ] [)][)][.] (11.46)

Next we replace z2[(][τ] [)] by a value z2[(][τ] [+1)] obtained by sampling from the conditional
distribution
_p(z2|z1[(][τ]_ [+1)], z3[(][τ] [)][)] (11.47)

so that the new value for z1 is used straight away in subsequent sampling steps. Then
we update z3 with a sample z3[(][τ] [+1)] drawn from

_p(z3|z1[(][τ]_ [+1)], z2[(][τ] [+1)]) (11.48)

and so on, cycling through the three variables in turn.

Gibbs Sampling

1. Initialize {zi : i = 1, . . ., M _}_

2. For τ = 1, . . ., T :

**– Sample z1[(][τ]** [+1)] _∼_ _p(z1|z2[(][τ]_ [)][, z]3[(][τ] [)][, . . ., z]M[(][τ] [)][)][.]

**– Sample z2[(][τ]** [+1)] _∼_ _p(z2|z1[(][τ]_ [+1)], z3[(][τ] [)][, . . ., z]M[(][τ] [)][)][.]
...
**– Sample zj[(][τ]** [+1)] _∼_ _p(zj|z1[(][τ]_ [+1)], . . ., zj[(][τ]−[+1)]1 _[, z]j[(][τ]+1[)]_ _[, . . ., z]M[(][τ]_ [)][)][.]
...
**– Sample zM[(][τ]** [+1)] _∼_ _p(zM_ _|z1[(][τ]_ [+1)], z2[(][τ] [+1)], . . ., zM[(][τ] [+1)]−1 [)][.]
