satisfied. Suppose the current value of z is denoted z[(][τ] [)] and that we have obtained
a corresponding sample u. The next value of z is obtained by considering a region
_zmin ⩽_ _z ⩽_ _zmax that contains z[(][τ]_ [)]. It is in the choice of this region that the adaptation to the characteristic length scales of the distribution takes place. We want the
region to encompass as much of the slice as possible so as to allow large moves in z
space while having as little as possible of this region lying outside the slice, because
this makes the sampling less efficient.

One approach to the choice of region involves starting with a region containing
_z[(][τ]_ [)] having some width w and then testing each of the end points to see if they lie
within the slice. If either end point does not, then the region is extended in that
direction by increments of value w until the end point lies outside the region. A
candidate value z[′] is then chosen uniformly from this region, and if it lies within the
slice, then it forms z[(][τ] [+1)]. If it lies outside the slice, then the region is shrunk such
that z[′] forms an end point and such that the region still contains z[(][τ] [)]. Then another
