Consider first the univariate case. Slice sampling involves augmenting z with
an additional variable u and then drawing samples from the joint (z, u) space. We
shall see another example of this approach when we discuss hybrid Monte Carlo in
Section 11.5. The goal is to sample uniformly from the area under the distribution

**Figure 11.13** Illustration of slice sampling. (a) For a given value z[(][τ] [)], a value of u is chosen uniformly in
the region 0 ⩽ _u ⩽_ _p(z[(][τ]_ [)]), which then defines a ‘slice’ through the distribution, shown by the solid horizontal
e
lines. (b) Because it is infeasible to sample directly from a slice, a new sample of z is drawn from a region
_zmin ⩽_ _z ⩽_ _zmax, which contains the previous value z[(][τ]_ [)].
