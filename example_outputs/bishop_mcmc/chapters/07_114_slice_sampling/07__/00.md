straightforward. Then we fix u and sample z uniformly from the ‘slice’ through the
distribution defined by _z :_ _p(z) > u_ . This is illustrated in Figure 11.13(a).

In practice, it can be difficult to sample directly from a slice through the distribution and so instead we define a sampling scheme that leaves the uniform distribution
under _p(z, u) invariant, which can be achieved by ensuring that detailed balance is_
