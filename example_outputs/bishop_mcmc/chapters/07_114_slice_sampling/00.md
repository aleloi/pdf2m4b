We have seen that one of the difficulties with the Metropolis algorithm is the sensitivity to step size. If this is too small, the result is slow decorrelation due to random
walk behaviour, whereas if it is too large the result is inefficiency due to a high rejection rate. The technique of slice sampling (Neal, 2003) provides an adaptive step size
that is automatically adjusted to match the characteristics of the distribution. Again
it requires that we are able to evaluate the unnormalized distribution _p(z)._
